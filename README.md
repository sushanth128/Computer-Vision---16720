# Computer-Vision - 16720

Professor: Deva Ramanan

This course introduces the fundamental techniques used in computer vision, that is, the analysis of patterns in visual images to reconstruct and understand the objects and scenes that generated them. The first third of the course covers low-level image processing, including filtering, warping, image descriptors, and correspondence matching. The second third of the course covers geometry and 3D motion, including image formation, camera models, optical flow, stereo, and structure from motion. The last third of the course covers pattern recognition including deep learning, convolutional neural networks. Additional topics include radiometry, color, and photometric stereo.

All the homework for Computer Vision (16720) offered by the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. I loved this course so much!
